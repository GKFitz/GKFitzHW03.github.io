# Gillian K Fitzgerald Random Password Generator:
This piece of javascript code generates a random password based on four categories of user selected symbols. The user may choose how long they want their random password to be between 8 and 128 characters, and have the option to include random numbers, letters (both upper and lower case), and special characters together, or any combination of the four categories.
For this project I have attempted to present the cleanest and most straightforward code in order to make the user experience as effortless as possible, in addition to maintaining a high level of readability for any future developers who may work on/with this code.
